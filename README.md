# DroneGuard System

> DroneGuard is a life-saving system that uses a drone as an tool to a lifeguard at the beach.
> The project was born as part of a final project in Software Engineering studies and gained interest from sources and exposure in the press.


The project combines work with hardware and includes the development of a dedicated application that controls the drone and the hardware components installed on it.
